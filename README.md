## About

This is a web app for photography enthusiasts who have no time and money to waste!

It helps people to quickly gain solid skills in creating amazing pictures and art, with required only a phone or any old camera.


## How to Use

On the 'Lessons' page a user can select a lesson from two categories - light or composition.

Users can then enroll in any of the 16 specialized lessons (14 for composition and 2 for lighting). Each lesson has clear instructions and many visual examples. 'Notes' section is also provided to enhance the learning process.

The user completes each lesson by building a mini gallery inside of it. He has to upload 10 of his best practice-pictures (photos that were taken following the lesson's instructions and examples).

Other visitors and users of the app can then comment and like the pictures, have discussions, select the better pictures and many others.

Have fun MAKE every picture you TAKE!!!
